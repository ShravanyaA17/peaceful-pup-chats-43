## Example AI Response

For someone who answered "yes" to feeling unprepared, "maybe" to sleep issues, and "no" to social problems:

> I can see that uncertainty about upcoming things is weighing on your mind right now, and that's completely understandable. When we feel unprepared, it can create this underlying tension that affects everything else...
>
> Here are some gentle steps that might help:
> • Write down 3 small things you can prepare for tomorrow to feel more ready
> • Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch...
> • Set a timer for 10 minutes and create a simple action plan for your main concern
>
> I'm glad to see that your social connections seem stable right now - that's a real strength to lean on...
