# 🐾 Peaceful Pup – Understand Your Unease

**Peaceful Pup** is a gentle, guided web app that helps you figure out *why* you're feeling anxious, uneasy, or emotionally off—especially when it's hard to put into words.

Rather than trying to fix your feelings with generic AI advice, Peaceful Pup offers a thoughtful **checklist-based approach** paired with **smart, human-style insights**. It helps you gently reflect, explore patterns, and feel more grounded—without overwhelming you.

## What It Does

When you're feeling off but don't know why, Peaceful Pup guides you through a curated list of emotional and situational prompts—like:

* “Did I have enough rest?”
* “Is there a conversation I’m avoiding?”
* “Am I sensing someone else’s emotions?”

Once you select what resonates, the app surfaces **smart insights**—simple explanations, patterns, or reminders that help you better understand your inner state. It's like a mindful checklist with gentle nudges, not robotic responses.
