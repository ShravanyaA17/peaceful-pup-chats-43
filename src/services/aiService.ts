I can see you're worried about an upcoming presentation - that anticipation anxiety is so real and valid.

**Immediate Action Steps:** âœ¨
1. **Break it down**: Spend 15 minutes right now creating a simple outline with 3 main points
2. **Practice the opening**: Say your first two sentences out loud 5 times - this builds confidence
3. **Prepare your safety net**: Write 3 key points on a small card as backup
4. **Get physical ready**: Lay out your clothes and materials tonight so tomorrow feels smoother

**Why This Helps:** ðŸ’¡
Taking small, concrete steps transforms overwhelming "presentation anxiety" into manageable tasks. Each completed step builds confidence and reduces the unknown factors that fuel worry.`;

      return `**Understanding Your Situation:** ðŸ«‚
Replaying conversations in your mind is exhausting - your brain is trying to solve something it can't control.

**Immediate Action Steps:** âœ¨
1. **Brain dump**: Write down exactly what's bothering you about the conversation (2 minutes)
2. **Reality check**: Ask yourself "What would I tell a friend in this situation?"
3. **Take action OR let go**: Either send one clarifying text/call, or consciously choose to stop replaying it
4. **Break the loop**: Do 10 jumping jacks or splash cold water on your face when the thoughts return

**Why This Helps:** ðŸ’¡
Overthinking keeps you stuck in mental loops. These steps either resolve the issue through action or train your brain to redirect energy toward things you can actually control.`;

Work stress can feel overwhelming when everything seems urgent and you're not sure where to start.

**Immediate Action Steps:** âœ¨
1. **List what you control**: Write down 3 tasks you CAN control vs 3 you cannot
2. **Pick the smallest win**: Complete one 5-minute task right now to feel progress
3. **Ask for clarity**: Send ONE email asking for help or clarification on the biggest concern
4. **Time-box worry**: Set a 10-minute timer to worry about work, then consciously stop

**Why This Helps:** ðŸ’¡
Separating controllable from uncontrollable reduces mental overwhelm. Small wins create momentum, and seeking clarity often reveals that problems are more manageable than they seemed.`;

Relationship concerns can create a lot of mental noise because they involve factors outside our direct control.

**Immediate Action Steps:** âœ¨
1. **Clarify your feelings**: Write down exactly what you need from this relationship
2. **One small gesture**: Send a simple "thinking of you" message or suggest a specific plan to connect
3. **Set a boundary**: Decide what you will and won't accept, then communicate one clear boundary
4. **Focus on your part**: List what YOU can do differently, ignoring what they should do

**Why This Helps:** ðŸ’¡
Relationship anxiety often comes from unclear expectations. Taking concrete action, even small steps, helps you feel empowered rather than helpless in the situation.`;
    }

    // Default response for other concerns
    return `**Understanding Your Situation:** ðŸ«‚
Thank you for sharing what's really on your mind. Your self-awareness about your specific concerns is actually a strength.

**Immediate Action Steps:** âœ¨
1. **Break it down**: Identify the smallest possible step you could take about this concern right now
2. **Set a boundary**: Decide how much mental energy you'll give this today, then stick to it
3. **Get grounded**: Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear right now
4. **Take one action**: Do ONE thing that moves you forward, even if it's tiny

**Why This Helps:** ðŸ’¡
When anxiety feels vague and overwhelming, specific actions help your brain shift from worry-mode to problem-solving mode. You have more control than anxiety wants you to believe.`;

It sounds like you're taking good care of yourself right now. That's wonderful to see! Sometimes we check in expecting to find problems, but finding stability is equally valuable.

**Keep This Momentum:**
1. **Acknowledge your wins**: Take a moment to appreciate what's going well
2. **Maintain your routines**: Whatever you're doing is working - keep it up
3. **Stay connected**: Reach out to someone who makes you feel good

**Immediate Comfort Steps:**
1. **Start with your body**: Drink some water, eat something nourishing, or take 5 deep breaths
2. **Ground yourself**: Name 3 things you can see, 2 you can hear, 1 you can touch
3. **One small action**: Pick the easiest thing you could do right now to feel 1% better
4. **Be kind to yourself**: You're doing the hard work of checking in - that takes courage

**Why This Matters:**
When multiple areas feel challenging, it's tempting to tackle everything at once. But small, gentle steps often create the most lasting change. You don't have to fix everything today. ðŸŒ±`;
